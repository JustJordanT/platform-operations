# platform-operations

A minimal Python GH policy project.



## Result

Using Python for running automated scripts for GH can be alot since you need to put in the logic for all the differnet things that you will be parsing for. ie if `isPrivate==False` Then change to `True`.  `else` `return`


Using `Pulumi` or `Terreform` could be more practicle since thia is already a supported previder.
